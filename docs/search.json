The variables of interest after preprocessing the datasets are listed below:\nIn the  Submissions  dataset :\n\n\n\nauthor : The user who created the post.\n\n\ncreated_utc : The time the submission or comment was posted. Was used in the time series analysis section of our project.\n\n\ndomain : The news site posted in the submission.\n\n\nid : The unique identifier of each post.\n\n\nnum_comments : The number of comments under each submission. This may not capture the exact picture as it is dependent on the day the data was retrieved.\n\n\nurl : The url associated with the post. Most of the submissions contain this url to the news article.\n\n\nscore : The Karma score awarded to each post\n\n\nIn the  Comments  dataset :\n\n\n\nauthor : The user who posted the comment.\n\n\ncreated_utc : The time the submission or comment was posted.

    "text": "For our Machine Learning (ML) Analysis we accomplished two separate tasks, one predicting comment sentiment and the second predicting comment controversy. We saw that an SVM model using cross validation was best at predicting comment sentiment, leading in all grading metrics we checked. This sentiment prediction model was saved following the results, with its training. For the models predicting comment controversy, we saw high overall accuracy, but that seemed to have been a result of class imbalance. We describe where the large imbalance between controversial and noncontroversial comments may have come from, and how it may have affected our results. \nAdditionally we attempted to implement a model outside of our business goals to see whether we would be able to predict karma scores. While we saw promising results for the first two, our karma scores models faced several issues and had what we considered ‘pitiful’ results, due to its low accuracy. We have chosen instead to include it in the further analysis section below."

    "text": "This project is based on the Push Shift Reddit Dataset and its related work which has served as the primary source for our data and has explanations for our variable’s meanings. The original data contains posts from all subreddits between June 2005 and April 2019, but for the purposes of our project we have restricted ourselves to the r/worldnews subreddit between January, 2022 and January 2023. It is one of the most active and subscribed subreddits on the website, with nearly 31.5 million subscribers as of April 2023. The subreddit was formed in January of 2008, and in its current form is a combination of discussion threads and posts which contain news stories, which can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach submission to the subreddit consists of the article title and a link to the material for users to examine after which they can return to reddit to share their thoughts on that particular news story. Unlike other prominent news and politics subreddits, r/worldnews is less America-centric in coverage and has a user base with greater ideological diversity. For this reason, it was selected to analyze the behavior of news consumers and the sorts of news products that are most successful in this supposedly neutral environment. The subreddit data we used consisted of 18,548,934 comments across 170,144 submissions, which is visualized in the figure below. It should be noted that upon analysis some temporal gaps in the data were found.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe also incorporated other data sources to expand our analysis, namely data from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Google Trends. Using these we sought to examine the timeline of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, which dominated the topics of the submissions. These datasets, we believe, allow us to better represent the events on the ground and media production, as opposed to the media consumption occurring within the subreddit.\nWithout going into the specific methods used, we also wish to highlight this project was accomplished using the Amazon Web Services(AWS) platform to work with Spark, and that we used a combination of several different models to achieve our goals, most notably pretrained models from JohnSnowLabs and models which we trained with our data from VaderSentiment. All the code can be found in the GitHub link located on the banner below of each page."

In order to do the natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the corpuses of comments and submissions needed to face several steps of processing as listed below:\n\n\nRemove stop words\n\n\nRemove other languages\n\n\nRemove special characters\n\n\nConvert text to lower case\n\n\nLemmatize words\n\n\nThe above listed preprocessing steps were applied to text portions of our submissions and comments datasets, on the columns title and body respectively. We used the johnsnowlabs package to conduct our preprocessing and implemented our preprocessing task through a pipeline. systematically converted to document file types and then tokenized. This transformed the data into a bag of words form and was used to accomplish the business goals below.\nAfter the preprocessing, we assessed the 15 most commonly occurring words in both the submissions and comments dataset as displayed in table 1.\n Table 3.1 : Most Common Words in the Submissions Datasets \n\n\n╒════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════╕\n│ Top Words in Submissions   │   Occurence in Submissions │\n╞════════════════════════════╪════════════════════════════╡\n│ ukraine                    │                      26704 │\n│ russian                    │                      19298 │\n│ russia                     │                      17456 │\n│ war                        │                       9411 │\n│ ukrainian                  │                       6740 │\n│ putin                      │                       6683 │\n│ china                      │                       5264 │\n│ world                      │                       4722 │\n│ kill                       │                       4711 │\n│ news                       │                       4638 │\n│ attack                     │                       4036 │\n│ we                         │                       4024 │\n│ military                   │                       3670 │\n│ force                      │                       3626 │\n│ report                     │                       3568 │\n╘════════════════════════════╧════════════════════════════╛\n\n\n Table 3.2 : Most Common Words in the Comments Datasets \n\n\n╒═════════════════════════╤═════════════════════════╕\n│ Top Words in Comments   │   Occurence in Comments │\n╞═════════════════════════╪═════════════════════════╡\n│ russia                  │                 2402776 │\n│ people                  │                 2123906 │\n│ russian                 │                 1659100 │\n│ ukraine                 │                 1618223 │\n│ war                     │                 1496956 │\n│ make                    │                 1477347 │\n│ country                 │                 1377832 │\n│ putin                   │                  989950 │\n│ time                    │                  978403 │\n│ thing                   │                  889382 │\n│ world                   │                  842894 │\n│ year                    │                  804429 │\n│ it                      │                  707501 │\n│ nato                    │                  669443 │\n│ good                    │                  668103 │\n╘═════════════════════════╧═════════════════════════╛\n\n\nIt is evident from both tables 3.1 and 3.2 that the Russia-Ukraine Conflict dominates both in the submissions and comments datasets.

    "text": "Key Topics in Submissions\nWe employed topic modeling through Latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA) on the cleaned titles of our submissions dataset and obtained 7 topic groups, which saw most of the groups dealing with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, addressing its different facets. The topics were:\n\n\nTopic 1: deals with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and nuclear weapons, power plants\n\n\nTopic 2: deals with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the media/news coverage on the political leaders\n\n\nTopic 3: deals with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and oil imports, the EU, laws, and regulation\n\n\nTopic 4: deals with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict as well as Twitter and Elon Musk\n\n\nTopic 5: news related to covid, China, and Korea\n\n\nTopic 6: deals with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and neighbouring countries\n\n\nTopic 7: the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the Qatar World Cup\n\n\nAs stated, several of these topics related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict directly. This high centralization of topic matter seemed to affect topics 4 and 7 which appeared to combine disparate subjects. The LDA topic visualization is displayed below.\n\nFigure 3.4 : LDA Topic Visualization for Submissions Datset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther viewing the , utilizing google trends data we were able to determine events in the conflict which most affected internet traffic. Using this we sought to examine how such key events affected the subreddit’s submissions, ie news coverage. The first event selected was the start of the war, which we used to create a subset of the data that encompassed the first two weeks of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and was modeled with only a topic count of 5. Its results saw the following topics:\n\n\nTopics 1, 2, 3, 5 all relating to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, with repeated terms (political leaders of both countries, cities in both countries, and weapons - missiles, nuclear, military, troops)\n\n\nTopic 4 provided an interesting insight - it includes news related to Indian students in Ukraine, as well as Starlink and Elon Musk.\n\n\nTo provide context, topic 4 highlighted the early involvement of Musk in providing his satellite services to the country and the Nazi Azov battalion accosting foreign students attempting to flee.\n\nFigure 3.5 : LDA Topic Visualization for Submissions Datset During the Start of the War\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The second event we used from the trends coverage, was when Russia began withdrawing. After applying LDA once more, we saw the topic modelling results indicated:\n\n\nTopics 1, 2, 3, 4 all relating to Russia-Ukraine Conflict, with repeated terms (political leaders of both countries, cities in both countries, and weapons - missiles, nuclear, military, troops)\n\n\nTopic 5 : news related to North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan.\n\n\nAs was stated, North Korea had fired a ballistic missile over Japan in the same time period and had been rapidly increasing the rate of testing. This appears to suggest that the smaller subsets of data might be more useful in capturing specific stories without overlapping the conflict with other topics.\n\nFigure 3.6 : LDA Topic Visualization for Submissions Datset When Russian Troops Started Receding"

We used BERT  pretrained  Named Entity Recognition (NER)  models to accomplish this. Initially, when feeding the pre trained model with our pre-processed data, we found that Russia and Ukraine didn’t feature as one of the top entities. Upon re-running the model pipeline with unprocessed data, the results were more familiar.\nGiven the density of topics demonstrated by the previous section’s analysis, the focus of the entities on the conflict should not come as a surprise. Using NER, we saw that just as the topics were heavily saturated with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, the results for most frequently mentioned entities demonstrated this as well.\nIn table 3.4, we can clearly see the prevalence of Putin, Biden, and Zelensky; but these persons are not the only noteworthy results. We also can see British political figures, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, taking a prominent role in the results. Considering the domain table from our EDA, British news coverage made up some of the most popular sources for posts. This could be the reason for the British political figures being highlighted by the NER model.\nWhen examining the locations results, we saw Ukraine and Russia occur with much greater frequency than the other states, followed by the United States, which appeared twice, and China to a lesser extent.\nLastly our organization based model appeared to return the most mixed results. The top three results were organizations that could easily indicate stories related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, but after this the results become less than ideal. Ukrainian cities, Russia, Covid, and Elon Musk were included in the results. This could be seen as a short coming of the models, but also testifies to the prevalence of the conflict in the subreddits submissions. It should also be noted that different n-grams and misspellings resulted in less refined results, and, as stated, the organization results were rather mixed.

We assumed that titles would have demonstrated more neutral sentiment, as the Vivek model demonstrated; but assuming that the results IMDB and Twitter models are more reliable, marketing tactics may be the culprit for the perceived negativity. Given how article titles have increasingly become the method of user interaction in social media, drawing attention with inflammatory language can be a tactic for increasing user interest. This perceived negativity might also be explained by the dominance of Western Media outlets in this subreddit, that was seen in the EDA analysis.\nWe attempted a lexicon based approach, but due to logistical issues we instead went forward with pretrained models  sentimentdl_use_twitter, sentimentdl_use_imdb and  VivekSentimentAnalyzer . In the future, we believe that training our own sentiment analyzer could improve the results."

    "text": "Business Goal -1 : We plan to analyze user activity in the r/worldnews subreddit. Doing so we will see what proportion of users participate in posting submissions and comments, checking if there exists hyperactive users in this space. Additionally, we will examine users with the most controversial comments; in order to determine how controversiality correlates with a user’s likeliness to have gilded/distinguished comments. \n\n Technical proposal:  We will generate tables from the data aggregated around the Users to answer the above questions. The number of distinct users posting or commenting will be compared against the total number of subscribers in the subreddit(obtained from an external source). Also, using this aggregated data, we plan to sort by the amount of controversial comments in order to see their total gilded and distinguished counts.\n\n\n \n\n Business Goal - 2 : We will find what are the general frequency trends in submissions and comments in the r/worldnews subreddit, and see how characteristic features of the subreddit vary across time and compare with the general trend. This could also be used to identify events which have affected changes in user behavior. \n\nTechnical Proposal : In order to perform time series analysis, the timestamp of the submission’s creation will be used. Data manipulations to find counts, averages, medians and other such measures of different variables in the dataset will be performed. These calculations will then be visualized over time to identify different trends in the data, check if they are consistent or not, and if possible, identify seasonality in the time series visualizations.\n\n\n \n\n Business Goal - 3 : We will examine, what are the most popular/upvoted news sources and stories in the subreddit, and check the count of ‘live threads.’ We will also check what these threads relate to. \n\nTechnical proposal : The most popular news stories can be derived from the score variable. The most shared news sites can be captured by aggregating on the domain column and assessing via the number of posts, comments, posts in the top 100, and the average scores. Live threads can be obtained using regex on the title column by applying an appropriate search term or using startswith().\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 4 : We plan to examine the most repetitive words in the comments under the top 5 news stories in the subreddit. \n\nTechnical Proposal : By sorting on the “score” column from the dataset, the most popular subreddits can be found. Then word clouds can be created to explore the most frequent words in the comments of the each of the top five submissions. These visualizations give a take-away of the popular topics in the subreddit.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 5 : Given the prominence of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, we wish to see if the r/worldnews subreddit capture all events it. \n\nTechnical Proposal:  In order to compare posts regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project) data was used. ACLED collects real-time data on locations, dates, actors, fatalities and types of all reported political violence and protest events around the world, from various international and regional news sources. The ACLED data for Ukraine and Russia were aggregated to obtain daily counts of sub-event types in the following categories:\nArmed Clashes Shelling/Artillery/Missile Attacks Remote Explosives/Landmines/IED Disrupted Weapons Use Based on the definitions of the aforementioned sub-events from the ACLED codebook, appropriate words were used to find daily counts of event type from posts’s title using regex. Then, both the datasets are merged on the event date, and their counts are compared using a heatmap to measure proximity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal - 6 : We wish to see what the main topics in the submissions of the subreddit are. \n\nTechnical Proposal: In order to identify the major topics under submissions related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, topic modeling with LDA will be performed. Particularly, the LDA method for topic modeling will be used as its results are based on conditional probability estimates. Titles will be pre-processed to remove stop-words, punctuations, and non-alpha characters (this ensures that titles in languages other than English are removed from analysis). The ideal minimum document frequency for LDA will be found with TF-IDF( Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 7 : We will examine what the key elements in the submissions are and what categories they can be classified to? \n\nTechnical Proposal: Named Entity recognition will be performed using johnsnow labs. We shall identify standard categories in the text data such as person’s name, geographic locations, and organizations.\n\nBusiness Goal - 8 : From previous analysis it was determined that the live threads were tied to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict. Given such a high stakes topic, were curious to see how the user base reacts to it. To do so we plan on determining the comment sentiments.\nTechnical Proposal: For conducting sentiment analysis, we will use pretrained models from johnsnow labs. Will will attempt several models to see comparative results, so as to verify our findings.\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal - 9 :\nBuilding on the pretrained model results, we wish to develop a lexicon based model using our data. This will allow us to apply sentiment labels to our data and apply supervised learning models.\nTechnical Proposal: After creating the sentiment analysis and topic models using vader sentiment analyzer to examine our lexicon, it is possible to train supervised models using the sentiment labels as the target variable.\n___ verify if the below portion is still true\nA portion of the data can be used in sentiment analysis to obtain the required labels and the remaining data can be labeled by training supervised learning models.\nBusiness Goal - 10 :\nKarma scores can often influence any user’s actions on a particular subreddit. We wish to see if individual user Karma scores can be predicted by the variables in our dataset?\nTechnical Proposal: After obtaining the set of users who post and comment, their Karma scores can be procured using the Reddit API. The Karma scores would then become our target variable and we can construct a number of predictors from the dataset such as number of submissions or comments posted, number of gilded comments etc.\nBusiness Goal - 11 :\nWe plan on generating a model that will predict controversiality based on the text data.\nTechnical Proposal: The text data will undergo tfidf weighting. After this, the text will be used as an input to predict what the controversiality is."

To generate these labels, we used the vaderSentiment python package and tweaked the cluster bootstrap script to install the packages on the driver nodes. A portion of the comments dataset (20%) was labelled using this Vader-Sentiment lexicon. These comments were then used to train a sentiment classifier using supervised learning models namely Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). After applying 5-fold cross-validation and tuning hyperparameters, we obtained evaluation metrics for the three models as displayed below in table 1.\n Table 4.1 : Evaluation Metrics for Supervised Sentiment Models \n\n\n╒══════════════════════════════════════╤════════════╤═════════════╤══════════╤════════════╕\n│ Models                               │   Accuracy │   Precision │   Recall │   F1 Score │\n╞══════════════════════════════════════╪════════════╪═════════════╪══════════╪════════════╡\n│ Logistic Regression Cross Validation │       0.91 │        0.92 │     0.93 │       0.91 │\n│ Mulitnomial Naive Bayes              │       0.72 │        0.74 │     0.8  │       0.72 │\n│ SVM Cross Validation                 │       0.92 │        0.93 │     0.94 │       0.92 │\n╘══════════════════════════════════════╧════════════╧═════════════╧══════════╧════════════╛\n\n\nFrom table 4.1, it is evident that Support Vector Machines performed the best.

During our preprocessing steps we removed comments that were listed as ‘removed’ or ‘deleted’. We suspect that such comments removal likely affected the predictive capacity of our data set, compounding on the already existing class balance issues.\n Table 4.2 : Evaluation Metrics for Controversiality Prediction Models \n\n\n╒═════════════════════════╤════════════╤═════════════╤══════════╤════════════╕\n│ Models                  │   Accuracy │   Precision │   Recall │   F1 Score │\n╞═════════════════════════╪════════════╪═════════════╪══════════╪════════════╡\n│ Logistic Regression     │       0.95 │        0.95 │     1    │       0.92 │\n│ Mulitnomial Naive Bayes │       0.75 │        0.96 │     0.77 │       0.82 │\n│ LinearSVC               │       0.95 │        0.95 │     1    │       0.92 │\n╘═════════════════════════╧════════════╧═════════════╧══════════╧════════════╛\n\n\nIn this table we see that both Logistic Regression and Linear SVC have seemingly perfect recall scores, a result of them almost entirely ignoring comments with controversiality  labeled as 1.

We saw that an SVM model using cross validation was best at predicting comment sentiment, leading in all grading metrics we checked. This sentiment prediction model was saved following the results, with its training. For the models predicting comment controversy, we saw high overall accuracy, but that seemed to have been a result of class imbalance. We describe where the large imbalance between controversial and noncontroversial comments may have come from, and how it may have affected our results. \nAdditionally we attempted to implement a model outside of our business goals to see whether we would be able to predict karma scores. While we saw promising results for the first two, our karma scores models faced several issues and had what we considered ‘pitiful’ results, due to its low accuracy. We have chosen instead to include it in the further analysis section below."

    "text": "Time Series Analysis\nThe next step to understanding the trends within the datasets was to plot multiple time series graph. Much like figure 1.2, a daily submission and comments frequency graph was also plotted as shown below.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThere are some points of interest evident in the plot above. The first is the occurance of temporal gaps in the data which could be attributed to the data collection process of the push-shift reddit dataset. Second, there is a peak in Submissions and Comments in late February, and upon marking the start date of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on the chart, it is apparent that this high volume of submissions and comments could have stemmed from the ongoing war.\nExporing further into this, the datasets were filtered to retain only observations regarding the conflict. After visualizing monthly frequencies of occurrences, it was found that the patterns observed in figure 2.3 were almost identical to the ones present in figure 1.2. This corroborates our earlier findings about increased activity in the subreddit during different phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nKarma scores often determine user activity in any subreddit. In order to identify the overall popularity of submissions, their scores quantiles per month were visualized. Scores are the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes that a submission receives. From the median line in the visualization, it can be interpreted that most submissions have a score between 10-30. Since the 25th percentile remains 0 for all the months, it can be inferred that there are submissions (although few) with an overall negative score. The scores from the 75th percentile line reveal that there are submissions with very high overall scores as well. Additionally, these high overall scores per month do not follow any similar trend to the median data, indicating that there may be a handful of submissions that contribute to a very high overall score in a particular month.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFinally, to further capture trends in submission posts, the monthly frequencies of five authors with the highest number of submissions in this time-period were visualized. From the graph, it can be inferred that some of the authors’ changes over time resemble the overall submission frequency plot. However, two other authors had submissions only during some months in the year. Infact, hieronymusanonymous’s submission frequencies were only during the second half of the year, indicating that there might be authors who did not post much about the Russia-Ukraine conflict."

ACLED collects real-time data on locations, dates, actors, fatalities and types of all reported political violence and protest events around the world, from various international and regional news sources. The ACLED data for Ukraine and Russia were aggregated to obtain daily counts of event types in the following categories:\n\n\nArmed Clashes\n\n\nShelling/Artillery/Missile Attacks\n\n\nRemote Explosives/Landmines/IED\n\n\nDisrupted Weapons Use\n\n\nThe submissions titles were analyzed using regex to find terms related to aforementioned event types to obtain daily counts for these events. The cosine similarity between ACLED counts and counts obtained from submissions for each event type were found as shown below in table 2.4. Our results indicate that reddit data is not quite similar to ACLED data. One possible reason for low similarity might be that our data has been filtered to English, and ACLED uses its own translation methodology and produces regional level news related to the conflict as well.\n Table 2.4 : Cosine Similarity Scores for ACLED and Submissions Dataset on Different War Events \n\n\n╒═════════════════════════════════╤═════════════════════╕\n│ War Event Type                  │   Cosine Similarity │\n╞═════════════════════════════════╪═════════════════════╡\n│ Armed Clash                     │           0.076989  │\n│ Shelling/Artillery/Missile      │           0.210093  │\n│ Remote Explosives/Landmines/IED │           0.0882741 │\n│ Air Drone Strike                │           0.050086  │\n│ Disrupted Weapons Use           │           0.115323  │\n╘═════════════════════════════════╧═════════════════════╛"

Doing so we will be able to see if controversiality correlates with a user’s likeliness to have gilded/distinguished comments in this reddit space. \n\n Technical proposal:  We will generate tables from the data, aggregated around the Users, to answer the above questions. The number of distinct users posting or commenting will be compared against the total number of subscribers in the subreddit(obtained from an external source). Also, using this aggregated data, we plan to sort by the amount of controversial comments in order to see their total gilded and distinguished counts.\n\n\n \n\n Business Goal - 2 : We will find what are the general frequency trends in submissions and comments in the r/worldnews subreddit, and see how characteristic features of the subreddit vary across time and compare with the general trend. This could also be used to identify events which have affected changes in user behavior. \n\nTechnical Proposal : In order to perform time series analysis, the timestamp of the observation’s creation will be used.

    "text": "This project is based on the Push Shift Reddit Dataset and its related work which has served as the primary source for our data and has explanations for our variable’s meanings. The original data contains posts from all subreddits between June 2005 and April 2019, but for the purposes of our project we have restricted ourselves to the r/worldnews subreddit between January, 2022 and January 2023. It is one of the most active and subscribed subreddits on the website, with nearly 31.5 million subscribers as of April 2023. The subreddit was formed in January of 2008, and in its current form is a combination of discussion threads and posts which contain news stories, which can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach submission to the subreddit consists of the article title and a link to the material for users to examine after which they can return to reddit to share their thoughts on that particular news story. Unlike other prominent news and politics subreddits, r/worldnews is less America-centric in coverage and has a user base with greater ideological diversity. For this reason, it was selected to analyze the behavior of news consumers and the sorts of news products that are most successful in this supposedly neutral environment. The subreddit data we used consisted of 18,548,934 comments across 170,144 submissions, which is visualized in the figure below. It should be noted that upon analysis some temporal gaps in the data were found.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe also incorporated other data sources to expand our analysis, namely data from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Google Trends. Using these we sought to examine the timeline of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, which dominated the topics of the submissions. These datasets, we believe, allow us to better represent the events on the ground and media production, as opposed to the media consumption occurring within the subreddit.\nWithout going into the specific methods used, we also wish to highlight this project was accomplished using the Amazon Web Services(AWS) platform to work with Spark, and that we used a combination of several different models to achieve our goals, most notably pretrained models from JohnSnowLabs and models which we trained with our data from VaderSentiment.

    "text": "This project aimed to analyze the comments and posts on the r/worldnews subreddit through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. In our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identified what news sites were primarily shared on the subreddit, via aggregated submission counts; began seeing what stories were most popular, based on karma scores; found that the discussion threads were heavily tied to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict; and examined the distribution of comments and submissions over time. We noted that several of the shared sites were American in origin, but also saw that many of the popular sources came from several European countries, including Russia. Other social media sites were also a popular submission choice, especially YouTube. Using the ACLED data, we were also able to determine that while the conflict was receiving a large share of attention, not all of the events of the conflict were being shared equally. Additionally, the time series analysis saw that there were multiple gaps in the dataset for certain time periods.\n Table 5.1 : Most Shared News Sites \n\n\n╒═════════════════════╤═══════════════╤═════════════════╤══════════════════╤═══════════════════════════╕\n│ News Site           │   No of Posts │   Average Score │   Total Comments │   No. of Posts in Top 100 │\n╞═════════════════════╪═══════════════╪═════════════════╪══════════════════╪═══════════════════════════╡\n│ reuters.com         │         10402 │         1005.53 │           941804 │                         2 │\n│ theguardian.com     │          5302 │          794.83 │           367433 │                         3 │\n│ bbc.com             │          3726 │          406.33 │           150686 │                         0 │\n│ youtube.com         │          3268 │            0.99 │             1395 │                         0 │\n│ youtu.be            │          3155 │            0.99 │             1478 │                         0 │\n│ apnews.com          │          2776 │          826.12 │           196241 │                         2 │\n│ aljazeera.com       │          2121 │          410.58 │            91511 │                         0 │\n│ businessinsider.com │          2107 │         3815.61 │           562551 │                        12 │\n│ cnn.com             │          1944 │          805.23 │           155646 │                         3 │\n│ pravda.com.ua       │          1702 │         2857.63 │           317834 │                         7 │\n│ newsweek.com        │          1658 │         2516.2  │           369312 │                         4 │\n│ bbc.co.uk           │          1637 │         1032.32 │           156512 │                         4 │\n│ timesofisrael.com   │          1519 │         1058.52 │           143717 │                         5 │\n│ twitter.com         │          1428 │            1.06 │              396 │                         0 │\n│ edition.cnn.com     │          1412 │         1022.95 │           127421 │                         2 │\n│ france24.com        │          1375 │          784.59 │            83869 │                         0 │\n│ msn.com             │          1357 │         1242.52 │           182079 │                         2 │\n│ dw.com              │          1225 │          782.35 │            76086 │                         0 │\n│ nytimes.com         │          1224 │          742.27 │            74875 │                         1 │\n│ news.sky.com        │          1176 │         1711.02 │           193815 │                         3 │\n│ bloomberg.com       │          1119 │         1021.3  │           105288 │                         1 │\n╘═════════════════════╧═══════════════╧═════════════════╧══════════════════╧═══════════════════════════╛\n\n\nIn the NLP stage of our analysis, we chose to look closer at the topics and entities that the submissions were about, as well as examine the sentiment of both the comments and submissions. In our topic modelling we found that using the whole data resulted in groups with substantial amounts of overlap regarding the conflict. We then constrained the data to time periods that saw high amounts of search interest in Google Trends, creating two subsets which included posts and comments that occurred up to two weeks after the designated event’s date. The resulting subsetted data produced clearer topic groups, with specific events being highlighted, although the cluster of groups which were hard to differentiate remained. For the sentiment analysis at this stage, we used pretrained models from JohnSnowLabs to examine both the sentiment of the comments in the threads as well as comments and submission titles related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict. Of the three different models used, Twitter and IMDB had identical results while the Vivek model registered a larger portion of the comments and submissions as neutral, but all three models indicated negative sentiment as the plurality of sentiments, if not the majority. The live threads’ results indicated strong sentiments, both positive and negative across the comments, a pattern which seemed to hold in the comments of submissions. The article titles, however, demonstrate much greater negativity according to the IMDB and Twitter models, while the Vivek model read it as again having more neutrality.\n Table 5.2 : Pre-Trained Models Sentiment Results on Comments and Submissions \n\n\n╒════════════════════════════╤════════════╤═══════════╤════════════╕\n│ Model                      │ negative   │ neutral   │ positive   │\n╞════════════════════════════╪════════════╪═══════════╪════════════╡\n│ IMDB Sentiment Analyzer    │ 52.54%     │ 4.32%     │ 43.30%     │\n│ Twitter Sentiment Analyzer │ 52.54%     │ 4.32%     │ 43.30%     │\n│ Vivek Sentiment Analyzer   │ 44.78%     │ 18.91%    │ 36.30%     │\n╘════════════════════════════╧════════════╧═══════════╧════════════╛\n\n\nLastly, we have successfully designed and implemented predictive ML models to predict controversiality markers and the sentiment of comments and submissions. The controversiality model took in a TF-IDF weighted vector of the comments and was able to achieve a high level of predictive strength, although that seemed to be a result, in large part, due to the class imbalance. We believe that the deleted and removed comments were likely controversial, and so the remaining controversial ones were not being predicted as well as we would hope. For the sentiment model we decided to use Vader-Sentiment lexicon to label our data rather than relying exclusively on pretrained models. The dataset we used to classify sentiment appeared to label more similarly to the Vivek model, with the plurality being negative but showing a larger proportion of neutral material. Several ML algorithms were then used to train the labelled dataset and we ultimately saw great success with test error at slightly above 8%.\n Figure 5.1 : ROC Curves for Different Predictive Models Used in Predicting Controversiality \n\n\n\n\n\nMoving forward, we feel that we can further improve our models via the use of over and under sampling techniques to deal with the class imbalance. Additionally, we believe that we can improve on a predictive model for karma scores that we attempted, although at present its accuracy can be described only as pitiful."
